This repository contains a MATLAB code example demonstrating an uncommon bug related to logical indexing with functions returning multiple outputs. The bug arises when logical indexing is applied to a function's output that consists of both numerical and logical components.  The original function exhibits unexpected behavior in specific cases. The solution demonstrates a corrected version that addresses this behavior, providing the expected results consistently.
